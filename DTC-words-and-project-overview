**Overview:** This set of exercises asks students to create text directions from a series of pictures and create pictures for a series of text directions. The iterations begin simply and advances through the assignments.

**Purpose:** These exercises are meant to help students understand how images and text need to work in concert in technical writing. They should help habituate students to putting directions in order in a logical way, labeling and referring to images, writing as a team, and doing peer review.

**Directions:** There are 3 assignments within this set of exercises, and each also has a separate peer review component. Ideally, it is meant for students working in teams. The assignments vary between asking students to work individually, asking students to work as a team, and asking students to provide peer review either individually and or in teams.

> **Assignment 1: Cake Time!**
>
> Step 1: Each team receives a set of images of some of the steps for baking a cake. ([File: Cake Time!](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Cake%20Time!.docx)).
>
> Step 2: As a team during an in-class session, outside of class meeting, or virtual meeting (using a videoconferencing platform), students should put the images in order, label them ("figure 1," etc.), write the text directions, and intersperse the images and text directions in a document.
>
> Step 3: The team should submit their work.
>
> Optional step 4: [Cake Time peer review](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Cake%20Time%20Peer%20Review.docx). See directions on the file.
>
> **Assignment 2: Pitching a Tent**
>
> Step 1: As individuals, students will receive either the text directions or images for either [Tent 1](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Tents%201%20and%202/Tent%201.docx) or [Tent 2](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Tents%201%20and%202/Tent%202.docx). (The instructor should divide the files so students only get the images or the text directions.)
>
> Step 2: On their own, each student should draw the images if they received text directions or write the text directions if they received the images. As with the last assignment, students should label all the images, intersperse the images and text directions, and submit their work.
>
> Step 3: Within their teams, students should then engage in the [Pitching a Tent Peer Review](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Tents%201%20and%202/Pitching%20a%20Tent%20Peer%20Review.docx) with another student who received the opposite part of the assignment (so students with images pair with students with text and vice versa).
>
> **Assignment 3: Building Furniture**
>
> Step 1: Each team will either receive the [Chair Text and Image Directions](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Chair%20and%20Bench/Chair%20Text%20and%20Image%20Directions.docx) or the [Bench Text and Image Directions](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Chair%20and%20Bench/Bench%20Text%20and%20Image%20Directions.docx). (The instructor should divide the files so students only get the images or the text directions.)
>
> Step 2: The teams will have to craft what is missing (either images or text for either Chair or Bench) either in class together or outside of class in person or virtually. Students may write to other teams for hints. Students should submit their work.
>
> Step 3: The two teams that received Chair should meet with one another to look over their work. Same with the student who received Bench. This is the [first round of the Building Furniture Peer Review](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Chair%20and%20Bench/Building%20Furniture%20Round%201%20Peer%20Review.docx).
>
> Step 4: One team of Bench and one team of Chair each should exchange their revised, complete directions (both text and images). In this [second round of the Building Furniture Peer Review](file:///C:/Users/mgn364/Box/DTC%20Me/Object%20to%20words%20project/Chair%20and%20Bench/Building%20Furniture%20Round%202%20Peer%20Review.docx), students from the opposite team (chair vs. bench) will attempt to build a low-fidelity ¼" model the furniture following the directions and share their experience with their peers.
>
> **Assignment 4: Words and Images Reflection**
>
> Step 1: Each individual student should write a short reflective essay that addresses each of the following prompts:

-   What have you learned about writing text-based directions?

-   What have you learned about creating images for directions?

-   What have you learned about the relationship between text and images in technical writing?

-   What differences did you notice between the pitching a tent exercise and the building furniture exercise? How did one asking you to assemble a ready-made product and the other asking you to fabricate a new item change the way the directions were written and presented?

-   After doing this process, what you think makes for clear directions? If you were telling someone how to create directions, what would you advise them to do?

> Optional step 2:- Have students read [this online article](https://instrktiv.com/en/ikea-manual/) about what makes good directions (with reference to Ikea) after they have written their reflection.
