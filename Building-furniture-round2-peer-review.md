Now you will look at the other project and offer peer review in teams. If you worked on Bench, you will match with a Chair team (and vice versa). As you look at the Bench or Chair directions created by the team, answer the following questions.

1.  Check for some basics:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Is each figure labeled?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do the text directions refer to each figure?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of
>
> the page)?

2.  For this set of questions, get some craft paper, foam core, cardboard, or other material and try to make the piece of furniture in Â¼" scale to the best of your ability. Feel free to use tape or other easily accessible supplies to connect the parts to one another.

> As you build the model, note where you had trouble with the directions here. (Be as specific as possible.)
>
> What images did you find helped you the most? Which ones helped you the least? Explain why.
>
> Based on your experience trying to follow these directions, suggest changes to the order, working, layout, images, or other aspects here.

3.  Share your finding with the team that authored these directions.

4.  What has this experience taught you about writing directions?
