**[Materials Required]{.underline}**

-   1/8-in. x 24-in. x 48-in. Hardboard (for templates)

-   1x6 x 8 ft. cedar boards (2)

-   2-in. galvanized screws

-   2x6 x 8 ft. cedar boards (2)

-   Thompson\'s Water Seal finish (1 pint)

-   Wood glue

**[Directions for Assembly]{.underline}**

> Make template

-   Mark one-inch increments on both ends and one side of the hardboard.

-   Draw grid lines using a combination square, straight edge and fine-point permanent marker.

-   Transfer the points to your hardboard grid where the shape intersects the grid lines in the drawing.

-   Draw lines connecting the points made on the grid.

-   Use a smooth, arcing arm movement to draw the gradual curve.

-   Use a quarter to trace the 1/2-in. radiuses at the bottom of the leg.

-   Use a jigsaw to cut out the pattern.

-   Align the backrest strut template to the centerline and bottom edge of the cedar piece and trace the shape.

-   Flip the template along the centerline to draw the other half.

-   Cut out the pieces with a jigsaw.

> Use template

-   Align it to centerlines drawn on the boards, trace around it, then flip it over the centerline and trace the rest of the shape.

-   Sand the edges of the curved pieces with a belt sander.

-   Cut all the pieces to the dimensions given in the Cutting List, using the templates for the legs and the top slat.

-   Cut out the shapes with a jigsaw.

-   Sand the pieces with a belt sander.

> Drill the Ends

-   Drill the ends of the hand grip holes with a 1-in. spade bit.

-   Lay out the hand grip hole in the top slat, then cut it out using a jigsaw and spade bit.

-   Rip the back and seat slats two inches wide using a table saw.

-   Lay out, countersink and drill all the screw holes for the slats and supports.

-   Sand all the pieces with 120-grit, then 150-grit sandpaper.

-   Round over the sharp edges with the sandpaper.

> Align the Seat

-   Use a carpenter\'s square to align the seat supports 90 degrees to the backrest struts, then glue and screw them in place.

-   Use glue and screws to attach the slats, too.

-   Screw the two seat supports (D) and curved top slat to the backrest struts using the spacing given in Fig. A.

-   Attach the five slats to the backrest struts and six slats to the seat struts.

-   Attach the Slats

-   Attach the slats to the seat struts using a 1/2-in. spacer to align them.

-   Finish driving the screws by hand to avoid setting their heads too deep.

> Finishing Touches

-   Before applying the finish, unscrew the two seat supports and apply weather-resistant glue (like Titebond II or Gorilla Glue) to the joints, then re-screw the seat supports to the backrest struts.

-   Brush on two liberal coats of a penetrating exterior wood sealer (like Thompson\'s Water Seal).

-   Let the first coat dry for 24 hours, then apply the second coat.

-   After an hour, wipe off any excess finish.

-   Let the finish dry for a couple of days before using the chair.
