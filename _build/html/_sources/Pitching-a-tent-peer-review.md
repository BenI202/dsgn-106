Look at your partner's work, and answer the following questions:

1.  Check for some basics:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Is each figure labeled?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do the text directions refer to each figure?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of
>
> the page)?

2.  Now, look for more nuanced choices and explain your reaction:

> How closely do the spirit of the images that you or your partner created match those of the official directions? (No weighing in on artistic ability.) What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
>
> How closely does the text directions that you or your partner created match those of the official directions? What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
>
> What other major differences exist between your two sets of directions? If you were going to create one document from your two, what choices would you make to include some of each of your work (without defaulting to the official directions)? Why?
>
> What other things do you notice about the two sets of directions?

3.  Share your finding with your partner. Decide which aspects of each set of directions you would include to make a new draft of "official" directions. Be able to explain why.
