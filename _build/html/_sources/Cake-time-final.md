**[Cake Time Directions:]{.underline}**

The images that follow tell part of the story of making cupcakes, but there are important steps missing and the images are not in order. (The measurements and oven temperature are also missing, but do not worry about that for this exercise.)

As a team, put the images in order and label them figure 1, figure 2, etc. Then, write the directions you think go with each image. In the directions, write "see figure X." After you have done that, write any additional directions you think are missing. Then, put the directions and images in order on the page. Be sure to think about and play around with layout.

Share your final version with another team. Note any differences between the choices each team made.
