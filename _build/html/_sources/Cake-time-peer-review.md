As a team, answer the following questions about another team's cake directions

1.  Check for some basics:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Is each figure labeled?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do the text directions refer to each figure?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of
>
> the page)?

2.  Now, look for more nuanced choices and explain your reaction:

> How did the team put the directions in order? Are they numbered or do they use page spacing or other ways to show the order? How are they different from your order?
>
> What directions did they add? Why? Are those different or the same to the ones you added?
>
> What other things do you notice about these directions?

3.  Share your finding with the team that authored these directions.
