# Learning Objectives

1.  Define *ethics* and *morality*

2.  Understand there exists theoretical ethics, professional ethics, and personal ethics

3.  Understand there are established professional codes of ethics

4.  Define and recognize *ethical dilemmas* and *ethical problems*

5.  Practice analyzing engineering ethic case studies

6.  Understand how ethics intersect with all areas of engineering and design

7.  Practice applying ethics to DTC project

# Ethics: Lecture 1

I.  [10 minutes]{.mark} *What is ethics?* Warmup question posed to students via Slido; they respond using phone/laptop and we project survey responses on screen.

II. [10 minutes]{.mark} Brief Lecture: PowerPoint on Ethics

III. [15 minutes]{.mark} 3 Case Studies: Divide auditorium into 3 sections (groups of 4 within sections) and assign each section 1 of the following cases:

-   "Unintended Effects"

-   "Time-Sharing Space"

-   "A Marshland's Fleeting Flourishing?"

> **Students will be asked to consider discussion questions (embedded in last slide of PowerPoint.)**

IV. [15 minutes]{.mark} **Group Discussion** - Volunteers with mics take question from several groups.

# Ethics: Lecture 2

I.  [5 minutes]{.mark} **Ask:** "What kinds of issues come to mind when you hear 'ethics' and design?" Project student responses to screen and respond. (Use Slido.)

II. [5 minutes]{.mark} **Individual Reflection:** Brainstorm on paper answers to the following:

> -What did you learn from Lecture 1 (Ethics) that you didn't already know?
>
> -What are 1-3 immediate thoughts you have when asked how 'ethics' is involved (or should be involved) in your design process?

III. [5 minutes]{.mark} **Mini Lecture:** Review central points from Lecture 1

IV. [10 minutes]{.mark} **In pairs:** Challenge yourself to think more about ethical issues, questions, or concerns with your design process.  Come up with 2-6 potential issues you hadn't previously considered. Base your discussion on the following areas:

> 1-[Design process]{.underline}: how might ethics impact or guide your group dynamics as well as the design process?
>
> 2-[Deliverables:]{.underline} what are challenges, questions, or concerns with the ethics of your design deliverables? Written deliverables?
>
> 3-[Big picture]{.underline}: how do you see your group design fitting into a bigger picture re: ethics? Think history of ethical failures/successes in design as well as how ethical concerns might inform the physical output of your process...

V.  [10 minutes]{.mark} **Groups of 4:** Discuss what you came up with in pairs.  Ask questions, present ambiguities, and use your larger group to gain a clearer sense of how ethics impacts design at various levels.  As a group, formulate 1 question you'd like to pose to the whole gathered group and designate a speaker to pose the question with the mic.

VI. [15 minutes]{.mark} **Group Discussion:** Come together to discuss as a large group (instructor with a mic will take questions from volunteer groups.)

# Ethics: Assessment Quiz for Canvas

1)  Though the terms are often used interchangeably, we stated distinct definitions for "Ethics" and "Morals"; give those definitions hea

2)  Identify the ethical problem in each case study. Describe it in a one-sentence problem statement.

3)  In no more than a paragraph, outline one potential solution responding to an ethical problem in your DTC project.
