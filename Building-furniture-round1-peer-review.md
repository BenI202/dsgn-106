As a team, answer the following questions about another team's Chair or Bench directions

1.  Check for some basics:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Is each figure labeled?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do the text directions refer to each figure?
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of
>
> the page)?

2.  Now, look for more nuanced choices and explain your reaction:

> How did the team put the directions in order? Are they numbered or do they use page spacing or other ways to show the order? How are they different from your order?
>
> How closely do the spirit of the images that your or the other team created match those of the official directions? (No weighing in on artistic ability.) What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
>
> How closely do the text directions that your or the other team created match those of the official directions? What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
>
> What other major differences exist between your two sets of directions? If you were going to create one document from your two, what choices would you make to include some of each of your work (without defaulting to the official directions)? Why?
>
> What other things do you notice about the two sets of directions?

3.  Both teams should get together to share their findings. After sharing your peer review, make another set of directions using the new text and the new images that you think is the best version of the directions, using aspects from both teams' work and trying to avoid using the "official" images and text as much as possible.
